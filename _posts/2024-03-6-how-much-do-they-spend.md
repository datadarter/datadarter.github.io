The new PM, Christopher Luxon, has been [under fire recently](https://www.1news.co.nz/2024/03/01/luxon-says-hes-well-within-the-rules-to-claim-52k-allowance/) for claiming an accommodation allowance to live in his Wellington home he owns mortgage-free while simultaneously asking government departments to cut their costs.

This got me thinking - what do MPs usually spend? There is often public outrage at any mention of MPs' spending in the news, but often these stories lack context about what is a 'standard' level of expenditure - a baseline to compare to.

The graphic below shows how parties' spending per seat trends over time, spending for the highest-spending MP for each party, and what each MP's average spend is across their time in Parliament.
